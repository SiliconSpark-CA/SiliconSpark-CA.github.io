2. Design modular architecture for easy feature additions  
3. Use placeholder APIs during development (e.g., mock weather data)  
4. Optimize for mobile-first experience  
5. Ensure all user actions provide clear feedback  

This SRS intentionally avoids implementation specifics to allow flexibility in technical approaches while defining clear functional goals.
